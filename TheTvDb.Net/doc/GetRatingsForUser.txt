Location
	<mirrorpath>/api/GetRatingsForUser.php?apikey=<apikey>&accountid=<accountidentifier>[&seriesid=<seriesid>]

Parameters
	<apikey>
	This is the API key that is registered to your application.
	<accountidentifier>
	This is the unique identifier assigned to every user. They can access this
	value by visiting the account settings page on the site. This is a 16
	character alphanumeric string, but you should program your applications to
	handle id strings up to 32 characters in length.
	<seriesid>
	This field is optional. If there is no value passed for this parameter the
	API will return all series that have been rated by the user.
	If you pass a valid seriesid the interface returns the UserRating and
	CommunityRating for that series. It will also return each episode in that
	series that the user has set a rating for. This will return both UserRating
	and CommunityRating.
