API:GetEpisodeByAirDate
This interface returns the full episode XML if an episode is found in the series
that has the correct air date. This is useful if you are looking up shows that
don't contain season and episode info but rather have the date in the title.

If an empty XML set is returned it means there was no episode in that series
with the airdate you specified.

If there is more than one episode for the series and air date you supplied only
one will be returned.
