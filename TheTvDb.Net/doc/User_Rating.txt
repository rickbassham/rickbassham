API:User_Rating
This interface allows you to send user ratings for series and episodes back to
the site from your software. It returns the resultant average for the item. For
most situations you will ignore the result.

Location

Parameters
	<accountidentifier>
	This is the unique identifier assigned to every user. They can access this
	value by visiting the account settings page on the site. This is a 16
	character alphanumeric string, but you should program your applications to
	handle id strings up to 32 characters in length.
	<itemtype>
	This is either series or episode, depending on which one they're rating.
	<itemid>
	This is the series id or episode id, depending on whether they're rating a
	series or episode.
	<rating>
	This is an integer value from 0 to 10. If 0 is sent, any existing user
	ratings for this series/episode will be removed. If a value from 1 to 10 is
	sent, that rating will be recorded for this user.
