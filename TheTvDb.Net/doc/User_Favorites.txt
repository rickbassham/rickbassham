Parameters
	<accountidentifier>
	This is the unique identifier assigned to every user. They can access this
	value by visiting the account settings page on the site. This is a 16
	character alphanumeric string, but you should program your applications to
	handle id strings up to 32 characters in length.
	<type>
	This is an optional field. If set, it should be either add or remove. Add
	will add <seriesid> to the user's favorites list, while Remove will
	remove <seriesid> from their list. If this field is not passed, the list is
	just returned without any modifications.
	<seriesid>
	This is a required field ONLY when <type> is set. This is the id of the
	series you're adding or removing for the user.
