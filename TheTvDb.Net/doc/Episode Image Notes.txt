There is a value called EpImgFlag on each episode record which returns an
unsigned integer. Below is a list of what each number means

1. 4:3 - Indicates an image is a proper 4:3 (1.31 to 1.35) aspect ratio.
2. 16:9 - Indicates an image is a proper 16:9 (1.739 to 1.818) aspect ratio.
3. Invalid Aspect Ratio - Indicates anything not in a 4:3 or 16:9 ratio. We
don't bother listing any other non standard ratios.
4. Image too Small - Just means the image is smaller then 300x170.
5. Black Bars - Indicates there are black bars along one or all four sides of
the image.
6. Improper Action Shot - Could mean a number of things, usually used when
someone uploads a promotional picture that isn't actually from that episode but
does refrence the episode, it could also mean it's a credit shot or that there
is writting all over it. It's rarely used since most times an image would just
be outright deleted if it falls in this category.
It can also return a null value, which just means it was uploaded before we
started storing this information. If it's 1 or 2 the site assumes it's a proper
image, anything above 2 is considered incorrect and can be replaced by anyone
with an account.
